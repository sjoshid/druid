# How to contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help] for more
information on using pull requests.

Every pull request should document all changes made in the [changelog].
- The format is always `- [what changed]. ([#pr-number] by [@username])`.
- The number can be guessed or added after creating the pull request.
- Links to all pull requests are recorded at the bottom of the unreleased section.
- If you are a new contributor, please add your name to the others at the bottom of the CHANGELOG.md.

If your name does not already appear in the [AUTHORS] file, please feel free to
add it as part of your patch.
